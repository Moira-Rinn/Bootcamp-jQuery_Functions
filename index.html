        <h1>Introduction to jQuery Functions</h1>
        <h2>The quick way to add functionality to your website!</h2>
      </header>
      <div id="click">
        <h2>The .click Function</h2>
        <p class="hideShowP">
          The .click function listens for a click even and then executes a
          function. In the example below, clicking on the buttons is the click
          even, and the function calls upon the jQuery functions .hide and
          .show, respectively. In this instance, this paragraph and the one
          below will be hidden or shown by targeting the class 'hideShow' which
          has been assigned to both.
        </p>
        <p class="hideShowP">
          Cick the buttons below to hide and show these paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p class="text"></p>

        <button id="hideBtn">Hide it!</button>
        <button id="showBtn">Show it!</button>
      </div>
      <div id="hideShowToggle">
        <h2>The .hide, .show, & .toggle Functions</h2>
        <p class="hideShowToggleP">
          The .hide, .show & .toggle functions, can simply hide anything
          visible, show anything hidden, or toggle between the two. This works
          by targeting the HTML element, class, or id of whatever you want to
          hide.
        </p>
        <p class="hideShowToggleP">
          In this example, these functions have an extra attribute assigned to
          them, duration, which provides a transition effect, rather than the,
          "now you see it, now you don't" suddeness of the default above.
        </p>
        <button id="hideDurationBtn">Hide w/ Duration...</button>
        <button id="showDurationBtn">Show w/ Duration...</button>
        <button id="toggleBtn">Toggle...</button>
      </div>

      <div id="slide">
        <h2>The . slideUp, .slideDown, & .slideToggle Functions</h2>
        <p id="slideP">
          The .slideUp, .slideDown, and .slideToggle are other transition
          functions that can be paired with different events to achieve
          different effects. In this instance they are just being used to hide
          and show, however they can be paired with hover and scrolling events
          to make certain features appear to accent the user experience.
        </p>
        <button id="slideUpBtn">Slide Up...</button>
        <button id="slideDownBtn">Slide Down...</button>
        <button id="slideToggleBtn">Toggle Slide...</button>
      </div>

      <div id="fade">
        <h2>The .fadeIn and .fadeOut Function</h2>
        <p id="fadeP">
          The .fadeIn and .fadeOut are, as might be obvious, fading transitions.
          Again they add more graceful animation to different aspects of the
          site which gives it a more professional feel and nice flow. The speed
          at which things fade, (as with all transition functions) can be
          regulated to suit the taste of the space.
        </p>
        <button id="fadeOutBtn">Fade Out...</button>
        <button id="fadeInBtn">Fade In...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="addClass">
        <h2>The .addClass & .removeClass Functions</h2>
        <p id="addClassP">
          The .addClass and .remoeClass functions are a great utility to add and
          change styling. They allow predefined classes to be added to or
          remomved from elements, in this case with a click event, but really
          with any eventlistener. These options present a lot of functionality
          and utility to really make the site dynamic and interactive.
        </p>
        <button id="addClassBtn">Add Class...</button>
        <button id="rmClassBtn">Remove Class...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="beforeAfter">
        <h2>The .before and .after Functions</h2>
        <p id="beforeAfterP">
          The .before and .after functions do pretty much what you would expect,
          they add somethting either before or after the target element. This is
          useful in certain situations, for example form validation when there
          is a error. It can also make the page more interactive and engaging.
        </p>
        <button id="beforeBtn">Add Before...</button>
        <button id="afterBtn">Add After...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="append">
        <h2>The .append Function</h2>
        <p id="appendP">
          The .append Function appends something to the element. It will
          continue to append that something so long as the eventlistener is
          triggered. In this instance the click even will continue to add a new
          sentence to this paragraph as many times as it is clicked.
        </p>
        <button id="appendBtn">Append...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="html">
        <h2>The .html Function</h2>
        <p id="htmlP">
          The .html function adds to or alters the elements HTML. Currently you
          are reading a paragraph element, but by clicking the button below it
          will change the element into an unordered list. Many other
          modifications can be made to transmute the page, making it very
          versital.
        </p>
        <button id="htmlBtn">HTML...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="attr">
        <h2>The .attr Function</h2>
        <p>
          The .attr, or attribute function modifiies or replaces an attribut of
          the HTML element. In this instance it adds an ID with a predefined
          style, but it can be used to change any attribute, which provides a
          lot of utility in a lot of different instances.
        </p>
        <button id="attrBtn">Attr...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="val">
        <h2>The .val Function</h2>
        <p>
          The .val function captures the value of an input element allowing it
          to be sent or displayed on the page. Here you can choose your favoite
          color and the button will store it in a variable and print it out
          below the select box.
        </p>
        <select id="favColor">
          <option>Red</option>
          <option>Blue</option>
          <option>White</option>
          <option>Black</option>
          <option>Green</option>
          <option>Purple</option>
          <option>Orange</option>
          <option>Pink</option>
          <option>Yellow</option>
          <option>Something Pastel...</option>
        </select>
        <p id="valP"></p>
        <button id="valBtn">Val...</button>
      </div>
      <div id="text">
        <h2>The .text Function</h2>
        <p id="textP">
          The .text function allows jQuery to modify the text of the element.
          This is very helpful to communicate with users to confirm or rebuke
          their input. It also alows for a more engaging experience by allowing
          the user to interact with the site via eventlisteners, such as the
          click even from pressing the button, and having the site respond.
        </p>
        <button id="textBtn">Text...</button>
